# ðŸš€ React Learning Journey - Episode 3: Dive Deep into JSX & Babel

## 1. Traditional (Normal) Way to Create Elements
In React, you can use the `React.createElement` method to create elements. This is the traditional way to define UI components without JSX.

### Example:
```javascript
const normalHeading = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  { id: "heading" },
  "I am Heading (Normal)."
);
```
- `React.createElement` takes three arguments: the element type, props (attributes), and children (content).
- This generates a React element, which is an object representation of the DOM.

## 2. JSX (JavaScript XML)
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows writing HTML-like code within JavaScript. It makes writing React components more readable and concise.

### Example:
```javascript
const jsxHeading = <h1>I am Heading (JSX).</h1>;
```

### How JSX Works:
- JSX is not valid JavaScript.
- It is transpiled by Babel into `React.createElement` calls.
- The result is a React element, just like the one created traditionally.

### Multiline JSX:
JSX supports multiline syntax by enclosing elements in parentheses.

```javascript
const multilinejsx = (
  <div>
    <h1>I am Heading (JSX).</h1>
  </div>
);
```

## 3. Differences Between Traditional and JSX
- **Traditional Way:** Verbose and less readable; uses `React.createElement`.
- **JSX:** Cleaner, more readable, and resembles HTML.
- Example with JSX:
  ```javascript
  const age = 38;
  const jsxexample = (
    <div>
      <h1 className="heading">The age is {age}</h1>
    </div>
  );
  ```
  JSX allows embedding JavaScript expressions using curly braces (`{}`).

## 4. React Components
React components are the building blocks of React applications. They define reusable pieces of the UI.

### Types of Components:
1. **Class-Based Components:**
   - The older way of writing React components.
   - Uses ES6 classes.
2. **Function-Based Components:**
   - The modern way of writing React components.
   - Functions that return JSX.

### Example:
#### Function-Based Component:
```javascript
const HeadingComponent = () => <h1>I am Component.</h1>;
```

#### Multiline Component:
```javascript
const HeadingComponent2 = () => {
  return <h1>I am Component 2.</h1>;
};
```

#### Nested Components:
You can call one component inside another.
```javascript
const HeadingComponent3 = () => (
  <div className="container">
    <HeadingComponent />
    <HeadingComponent />
    <HeadingComponent />
    {HeadingComponent2()} {/* Calling a component */}
    <h1>I am Component 3.</h1>
  </div>
);
```

---

## 5. Rendering Components
React uses the `ReactDOM.createRoot` method to render components into the DOM.

### Example:
```javascript
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<HeadingComponent3 />);
```
- The `root.render` method is used to display the component.

## Summary of Concepts Learned:
1. **React.createElement**: Traditional way to create elements.
2. **JSX**: A cleaner, more readable syntax for writing React elements.
3. **Multiline JSX**: Use parentheses to write multiple lines of JSX.
4. **Differences Between Traditional and JSX**: JSX is simpler and more intuitive.
5. **Components**: Reusable building blocks of UI.
   - Types: Class-Based and Function-Based.
   - Nested Components: Components can include other components.
6. **Rendering**: Use `ReactDOM.createRoot` to render components into the DOM.
