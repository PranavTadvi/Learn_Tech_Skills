# **React Learning Journey - Episode 19: Lifting State Up & Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components**

## **Overview**

This learning session covers key concepts in React, specifically:

- **Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components**
- **Lifting State Up**
- **Understanding Data Layer and UI Layer**
- **Using React Developer Tools for debugging**

In this lesson, a **filtering UI component** is built using an **accordion-style menu**. The state is managed in the `Men` component, making it a **controlled component**.

---

## **Concepts Covered**

### **1. Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components**

#### **Controlled Components:**

- Controlled components are components where React manages the form elements using state.
- Every state change updates the component, ensuring React is in control.
- In this example, the `open` state is lifted to the parent component (`Men`) and passed as props to `Accordian`.

#### **Uncontrolled Components:**

- Uncontrolled components are form elements where the DOM itself maintains the state.
- They use `useRef` instead of `useState`.
- Since this example manages state via React, it is a **controlled component**.

### **2. Lifting State Up**

- Instead of managing the state inside each `Accordian` component, the state is lifted to the `Men` component.
- This allows one component (`Men`) to control all `Accordian` components, enabling synchronized UI updates.

### **3. Data Layer vs UI Layer**

- **Data Layer**: The state, which contains data, is stored in the parent component (`Men`).
- **UI Layer**: The `Accordian` component renders based on the state passed as props from the parent component.

### **4. Debugging with React Developer Tools**

- Used to inspect state, props, and component hierarchy.
- Helps visualize how the state changes when interacting with UI elements.

## **Code Implementation**

### **1. `Men.js` (Parent Component)**

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import Accordian from "../components/Accordian";

export const Men = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(0); // State to track which accordian is open

  return (
    <div className="max-w-6xl mx-auto mt-10">
      <h1 className="font-bold text-xl mb-5">Filter Products</h1>
      {["Brand", "Mens", "Gender", "Kids"].map((title, idx) => (
        // Passing state and update function to child component
        <Accordian
          title={title}
          key={idx}
          open={idx === open}
          setOpen={() => setOpen(idx)}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### **Explanation:**

- `useState(0)` initializes the `open` state.
- `open={idx === open}` ensures only one accordion is open at a time.
- `setOpen={() => setOpen(idx)}` updates state when an accordion is clicked.

### **2. `Accordian.js` (Child Component)**

```jsx
import ListItems from "./ListItems";

const Accordian = ({ title, open, setOpen }) => {
  return (
    <div className="my-1 px-4 py-2 rounded-md border border-gray-200 shadow-lg w-64">
      <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
        <h1 className="text-md">{title}</h1>
        <button className="text-xl font-bold" onClick={setOpen}>
          {open ? "â–¼" : "â–²"}
        </button>
      </div>
      {open && (
        <div>
          <ListItems />
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Accordian;
```

#### **Explanation:**

- Accepts `title`, `open`, and `setOpen` as props.
- Uses conditional rendering to show/hide `ListItems`.
- Calls `setOpen()` on button click to update the state in the parent component (`Men`).

---

### **3. `ListItems.js` (List Component)**

```jsx
const ListItems = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <ul className="text-sm ml-2">
        <li>Women</li>
        <li>Boys</li>
        <li>Girls</li>
        <li>Kids</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ListItems;
```

#### **Explanation:**

- Displays a list of items inside an open accordion.
- This component is rendered only when `open` is `true`.

---

## **Key Takeaways:**

âœ… **State is lifted** to the parent (`Men`) so only one accordion can be open at a time.
âœ… **Accordian is a controlled component**, meaning its behavior is fully managed by React.
âœ… **Uses conditional rendering** (`{open && <ListItems />}`) to display content only when needed.
âœ… **Efficient state management**, avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

---

## **Possible Enhancements:**

ðŸ”¹ Add animations for opening and closing accordion items.
ðŸ”¹ Allow multiple accordions to be open at once by changing the `open` state logic.
ðŸ”¹ Use a `useReducer` hook for better state management when dealing with more complex accordion structures.

## **Final Thoughts**

This learning session helped in understanding **controlled components, lifting state up, and managing UI efficiently**. Using the **React Developer Tools** allowed for a better debugging experience. Mastering these concepts is crucial when building scalable React applications!
